				<h3>Project Title: LzyMg aka (LazyMug)</h3>
				<br>

			<p>For this module project, I intend to build a self-stirring mug that essentially mixes any powdered mix with the liquid inside of it. It is a simple yey efficient product for those may be busy and simply do not want to waste time stirring their drink before going back to work. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<p>It is a 4-step simple product to use:
			<ul>
				<li>Insert water or preferred liquid</li>
				<li>Insert any powdered mix</li>
				<li>Switch it on and watch in awe as it stirs on its own!</li>
				<li>Switch it off once mixture is fully mixed. Simple!</li>
			</ul>	

			<p> << Following is a sketch of how the intended product is to be, as a start. The product would have a similar structure to the existing mugs, only that instead of a handle, it would don an adjustable strap which would be for portability. 
			<br> 
			<p> My product would also have a clear body so as to view the motor in control. This also allows the user to see if their drink is fully mixed.
			<br>
			<p> The product would have a lid/cover for non-spillage purposes. It would also have an on and off switch for the user to decide the duration of self-stirring.
			<br>
			<p> This product may not be relatively new in the market as many have been sold on online shops like Shopee, Lazada and more. However I intend to use these sites and designs as a reference to how i am going to modify it and make it different from the rest.
