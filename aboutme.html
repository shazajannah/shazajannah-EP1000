					<td> <p> My name is Shaza J. and I live in the North area of Singapore, specifically between Woodlands MRT and Marsiling MRT. I am a student of Singapore Polytechnic, and am currently pursuing the course of Diploma in Maritime Business. I joined SP at 19 years in the year of 2019 and I am in Year 2, Semester 2.

						<p> I chose Digital Fabrication & Prototyping because I wanted to try out something new that my course does not offer. As a person who was interested in Design and Technology ever since secondary school, I've always been into making sketches/ideas come to life. The idea of creating something into a final product from just ideating intrigues me and it has since been a dream of mine. I did Autocad for a fan, used many tools in the workshop at my school, and even joined an after-school session to learn more about the subject.

						<p>After secondary school, there weren't really any outlets for me to create a 3d object from softwares thus the interest remained stagnant. However, when I joined SP and saw that i could choose an elective of my liking, I was elated and proceeded to choose this module. I hope to learn more about softwares and mechanisms/electronics that I can eventually put into my final product that I will be proud to call my own.</td>
